Notes 01

Written code (assembly code) is stored in a regular text file with a ".java" extension.
Set up a file by right clicking in your documents and creating a text file; rename it with the ".java" extension.
Print function: System.out.println(" ");
To save: ctrl + s
Compiling: the process of translating assembly code into Java bytecode
F6 executes the NppExec plugin.
".class" files contain bytecode.
Java Virtual Machine reads bytecode -> machine code

Basic Setup:
public class filename
{
	public static void main (String[]args)
	{
		System.out.println(" ");
	}
}

Escape characters: a character preceded by a backslash (\) is an escape sequence that allows for the printing of 
special characters.
ASCII art: art/imagery made from typed computer text/symbols
